&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my sophomore year, I joined the robotics team because I thought  I would enjoy it. I learned a lot about robotics during this time. Our robot for the 2020 FRC challenge had to be able to shoot balls through a goal, hand on a metal bar, and spin a color wheel. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our design was quite interesting. We used polycarbonate sheets to keep the balls from falling out the back and the bottom in the storage space. Our intake was created by putting two mecanum wheels on each side of rubber wheels. The mecanum wheels would work to push the ball towards the blue rubber wheels, which would push the ball into the storage space. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the hanging part to be the most interesting of all the sections (and I might be somewhat biased because I designed the system with a friend). We used a pneumatic system that compresses the air and allows the pistons to go up and down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there was a weight limit of 125 lbs. we had to scrap the color wheel part since it would give us the least points.
