&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge was the same for 2021, so the season was spent making the 2020 robot better. The Jesuit team had to create a new hanging mechanism. There was no space for a pneumatic system, so we caded and created an arm that maximized the amount of space that was left while still being under the weight limit. We designed the arm pieces in CAD and used wood sheets and the laser-cutter to bring our design to life.
