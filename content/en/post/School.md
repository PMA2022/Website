I will be graduating from Jesuit College Preparatory School in the Class of 2022. 

I attended Windermere Preparatory School from 6th until 10th grade. During the summer between 11th and 12th grade, I had to move to Texas because my father got a new job. I moved to Jesuit but I was forced to stay in a hotel for the first semester. In addition to this I was online for most of first semester. I did get into some extra cirriculars during the fall such as swimming and band. I made some of my closest friends in that short amount of time.
